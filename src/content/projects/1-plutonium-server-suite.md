## Overview

**Plutonium Linux Server Suite** is a comprehensive ecosystem of tools designed to simplify the deployment, configuration, and management of Call of Duty game servers on the Plutonium platform for Linux systems. This suite combines automated server installation scripts, key generation utilities, and API services to provide a complete solution for hosting Plutonium multiplayer and zombie servers.

The project addresses the complexity of running Windows-based Call of Duty servers on Linux through Wine, automating everything from system configuration to server key generation, making it accessible even for users without extensive Linux or gaming server experience.

## The Challenge

Running Call of Duty servers on Linux presents several technical challenges:

- **Windows Compatibility** - Call of Duty servers are Windows applications requiring Wine configuration
- **Complex Dependencies** - Multiple system packages, .NET Framework, and specific Wine versions needed
- **Server Key Generation** - Plutonium requires game ownership for official key generation
- **Manual Configuration** - Extensive manual setup of firewall rules, ports, and server parameters
- **Resource Management** - No built-in monitoring or resource limits for server processes

This suite automates all these pain points into a streamlined, user-friendly solution.

## Project Components

This suite consists of four interconnected repositories working together:

### 1. **T6Server** - Black Ops II Server Installer

### 4. **Plutonium Key Generator API** - Flask-based Key Service
Containerized Python Flask API providing automated server key generation backend.

**Repository**: [github.com/Sterbweise/plutonium-key-generator-api](https://github.com/Sterbweise/plutonium-key-generator-api)

**Key Features**:
- RESTful API for key generation
- Docker containerization for easy deployment
- Automated Selenium-based key extraction
- Environment-based configuration
- Rate limiting and security features
- JSON response format
- Integration with Rust CLI client

## How It All Works Together

The suite follows a complete workflow from server installation to key generation:

```
1. Server Installation (T6Server/T5Server)
   ↓
   - Install Wine, dependencies, .NET Framework
   - Configure firewall and network ports
   - Set up directory structure
   - Download server binaries

2. Key Generation (CLI Tool)
   ↓
   - User runs plutonium-key-generator
   - Selects game and mode (Multiplayer/Zombie)
   - Enters server name

3. API Processing (Flask API)
   ↓
   - Receives request from CLI tool
   - Uses Selenium to automate Plutonium platform
   - Generates temporary 48-hour server key
   - Returns key to CLI tool

4. Server Configuration
   ↓
   - Apply generated key to server config
   - Launch server with monitoring
   - Server appears in Plutonium server list
```

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

**Server Installers (Bash)**:
- Modular script design with functions for each setup step
