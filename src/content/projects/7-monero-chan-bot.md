## Overview

**Monero-Chan** is a Discord bot I built as a learning project to explore Python bot development and the Discord API. Inspired by Monero-Chan, the mascot character for the Monero cryptocurrency, this bot was my first attempt at creating an interactive Discord application.

This was primarily a learning exercise to understand how Discord bots work, how to handle events, and how to structure a Python project with external APIs.

## What I Learned

Building this bot taught me several key concepts:

- **Discord.py Library** - Working with the discord.py library to interact with Discord's API
- **Event Handling** - Understanding asynchronous programming and event-driven architecture
- **Bot Authentication** - Managing bot tokens and secure credential handling
- **Python Project Structure** - Organizing code, managing dependencies with pip
- **API Integration** - Making requests to external APIs and handling responses

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3** - Core programming language
- **discord.py** - Discord API wrapper library
- **pip** - Package management

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure bot token in main.py
# Replace 'TOKEN' with your Discord bot token

# Run the bot
python3 main.py
```

## Project Purpose

This was a simple experimental project to:
- Learn the basics of Discord bot development
- Practice Python programming
- Understand asynchronous event handling
- Explore API integration patterns

**Note**: This was an early learning project and may not follow all best practices. It served its purpose as a stepping stone to understanding bot development.
